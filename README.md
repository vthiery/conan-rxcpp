## IMPORTANT

**Since [conan-io/conan-center-index](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index) maintains a recipe packaging [ReactiveX/RxCpp](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxCpp) library, this recipe will not be maintained anymore. If possible, please use the package [rxcpp](https://conan.io/center/rxcpp/4.1.0/) instead.**

## Usage
